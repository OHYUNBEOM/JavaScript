        Cascading Style Sheets , or Cascading Style Sheets ( Cascading Style Sheets , CSS ) is a markup language, a language that describes how the actual display [1] , HTML and XHTML mainly used in, XML can be used in. It is a standard of W3C and has high degree of freedom when defining layout and style.

If the markup language (ex: HTML ) is in charge of the body of the website , CSS is in charge of decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure intact and changing only the CSS file .

In the case of CSS3, which is currently being developed , a function to replace images created with graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradients , and transformations has been added. In addition, various animation functions have been added , replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
